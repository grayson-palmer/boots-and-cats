# Boots and Cats (or Which Beyonce)

# A solo project to create a memory/matching game

# Learning Goals

- Continue to improve on building responsive client-side applications with good user feedback
- Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using localStorage
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model using multiple object classes
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
- Utilize grid for styling

#OverView of Site

- The site is a version of a memory game
- The site allows a single user to play the game
- Round time is tracked in the background and presented once completed
- User scores are stored in the leaderboard in the top left dropdown, and are sorted by shortest to longest duration
- Style/content of what the card content was left open to taste if desired, so comp does exactly match (boots and cats vs Beyonce)

# Technologies used
- VS Code
- DEV Tools (including debugger)
- Terminal

# Challenges

A large challenge for me was getting the card animations and interactions functioning correctly. There were a lot of issues with how I targeted the cards. I also had a hard time getting my cards styled correctly on the grid. Manipulation between the object classes was also a problem for a while.

# Wins!!!

Getting my cards to flip back was my largest challenge, and my largest win. It did require refactoring the way I selected the cards, but I was able to get it to function correctly. Another win was local storage, and array sort functions.
